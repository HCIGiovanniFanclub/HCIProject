      Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what their action has led them
      to. For example, users would appreciate a “Thank You” message and a proof
      of purchase receipt when they’ve completed an online purchase. An example
      is the screen once you send money on CashApp. After you send money a green
      circle with a checkmark will appear letting the user know the payment
      sent. It will also tell the user how much and to who they sent the money
      to.
