      The user should know where they are at and what is going on at all times.
      For every action there should be appropriate, human-readable feedback
      within a reasonable amount of time. A good example of applying this would
      be to indicate to the user where they are at in the process when working
      through a multi-page questionnaire. A bad example we often see is when an
      error message shows an error-code instead of a human-readable and
      meaningful message.
