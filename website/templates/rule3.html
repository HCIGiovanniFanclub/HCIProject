<h1>
  Offer informative feedback. The user should know where they are at and what is
  going on at all times. For every action there should be appropriate,
  human-readable feedback within a reasonable amount of time. A good example of
  applying this would be to indicate to the user where they are at in the
  process when working through a multi-page questionnaire. A bad example we
  often see is when an error message shows an error-code instead of a
  human-readable and meaningful message.
